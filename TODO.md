Feature requirements:

- create lambda that receives one url and scrapes the data
- create lambda that receives urls and triggers the scraper on each of them in an async manner
- post scraped data in the same way the sneaker api post request does
- assure minimal error handling (find edge cases and ignore them)
- update openapi specs
