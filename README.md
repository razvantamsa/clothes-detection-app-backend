# SoleSearch - Never settle for ordinary kicks again
<br>

## Welcome to the SoleSearch Open-Source Backend Repository

For my bachelor's project, I have created a software app called SoleSearch, which aims to revolutionize the way sneaker enthusiasts search for their next pair.

## Description
The rise of e-commerce has made online shopping a convenient option for consumers, but finding the perfect product can still be a challenge. \
However, with the advancement of technology, there are now tools available to make the search easier. \
One such tool is **SoleSearch**, an app that can detect sneakers in pictures found on the internet with the help of machine learning algorithms and search for the nearest shop selling this pair of shoe. \
**SoleSearch** could revolutionize the way we shop for sneakers, providing a quick and hassle-free experience for users. It could also be beneficial for both retailers and consumers, as it could increase sales and provide more options for shoppers. With this innovative technology, we may be looking at a future where finding the perfect pair of sneakers is just a click away.
